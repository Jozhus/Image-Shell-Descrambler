# Image-Shell-Scrambler-And-Descrambler
A dumb program inspired by Gmask, a program popular quite a few years ago that would de-scramble parts of an image. Gmask had multiple different types of ways to de-scramble an image, where as this program focused only on the rotation of a ring of pixels that make up an image.
